# Project Title: Land Title Management System

## Project Description

The Land Title Management System is a decentralized smart contract application that allows users to register, transfer, and verify ownership of land properties on a blockchain. The system utilizes Aptos, a high-performance blockchain, to ensure secure and transparent land ownership management. This system is designed to help streamline the process of land transactions while offering a permanent, verifiable record of ownership.

## Project Vision

The vision of the Land Title Management System is to revolutionize land ownership verification by providing a blockchain-powered solution that is transparent, secure, and immutable. With this project, we aim to reduce fraud and disputes associated with land ownership while promoting a more efficient and accessible process for transferring property.

## Future Scope

The future scope of this project includes:

- **Integration with GIS Systems**: Incorporating geographic information systems (GIS) to map land properties visually and associate them with land titles.
- **Support for Payment Mechanisms**: Enabling payments for land transfers via blockchain-supported currencies, allowing for seamless transactions.
- **Land Management Dashboard**: Developing a user-friendly interface for users to view, manage, and transfer land titles efficiently.
- **Interoperability with Other Blockchains**: Extending the platform to work with other blockchain networks to allow for cross-chain ownership validation.
- **Smart Contracts for Land Disputes**: Implementing a smart contract system for resolving land disputes in a decentralized manner.

## Key Features

- **Land Registration**: Land can be registered using a unique `land_id`, location data, and size. Ownership is recorded and secured on the blockchain.
- **Ownership Transfer**: The system supports secure transfer of land ownership from one address to another, ensuring that only the current owner can initiate a transfer.
- **Ownership Verification**: Anyone can verify the current owner of a piece of land by querying the blockchain.
- **Immutable Records**: All transactions are permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof ownership records.

### Code Snippet Overview:

The system works by defining a `Land` struct with properties such as `land_id`, `location`, `size`, and `current_owner`. There are three key functions in the contract:

1. **register_land**: Registers new land with a unique land ID.
2. **transfer_land_ownership**: Transfers ownership of land to a new address.
3. **verify_ownership**: Verifies the current owner of a piece of land by querying the blockchain.

The system uses Aptos' framework for managing accounts and assets (e.g., `AptosCoin` for payments) and ensures secure, transparent transactions.
